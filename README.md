# [Ticketing System Project](https://moath-ticketing-system.onrender.com)

## This is project is a challenge by me for me, ticketing system frontend was built using react along with apollo client as the app state manager for the frontend and ExpressJs & Graphql for the backend

---

### Description: this project was made for the concept of tickets, like you're an organization and want to make a bridge between your contact center and your technical support team, well this is the app you want, you can create an account for your organization with a passcode, and then you can create users accounts (for employee) with a specific roles:

- agent
- back office
- network department

## where everyone can make tickets and products but the agents can't reply to the "open tickets" but others can
